(1) industry technology equipment level is generally improved. Annual output of 5 million square meters ability of modified asphalt waterproof coiled material production line, better performance of epdm waterproofing extended vulcanizing pot has been put into operation. (2) application products increases obviously, obviously improve the production technology, product structure is obviously improved. SBS/APP modified asphalt waterproofing materials, polymer waterproofing materials, high-grade waterproof coating are sustained growth, substantial increase in high-grade building sealing materials. (3) to carry out the restrictions on the use of products and technology policy has a breakthrough. Standard polyethylene polypropylene fiber waterproof coiled material production and application, the timely development and promotion of environmental protection waterproof materials and other obvious effect. (4) to ban the use of products and technology policy implemented in different range and extent. Out annual output of 1 million fetal asphalt paper linoleum volume capacity production line, coal tar oil waterproof coating and sealing materials have been well implemented, secondary molding polyethylene polypropylene fiber coil has been largely withdraw from the market. (5) the research and development of new products, new technologies and the introduction of a variety of results. Polymer waterproofing materials for the development of adhesives, adhesive tape, glass fiber asphalt shingle, adhesive waterproof coiled material production and application technology development, the development of the metal bond metal coil, coil, provides more choices for waterproof project";s:8:"keywords";s:12:"油价上涨";s:11:"description";s:48:"油价上涨激发勘探业石油钻探设备出";s:8:"contents";s:1494:"家具一系列产业政策的贯彻实施，得到广大防水企业的积极响应，对我国防水行业调整产业结构、实施宏观调控、推广新型防水材料、打击假冒伪劣产品、规范防水市场和推动行业技术进步，引导行业健康发展起到了有力的促进作用。（1）行业的工艺装备水平普遍提高。年产500万平方米能力改性沥青防水卷材生产线不断增多，性能更好的三元乙丙防水卷材加长硫化罐已投入运行。（2）推广应用产品明显增长，生产技术明显提高，产品结构明显改善。SBS/APP改性沥青防水卷材、高分子防水卷材、中高档防水涂料均持续增长，中高档建筑密封材料大幅度增长。（3）落实限制使用产品和技术政策有突破性进展。规范聚乙烯丙纶防水卷材生产和应用，适时开发和推广环保型防水材料等显见成效。（4）禁止使用产品和技术的政策在不同范围和程度上得到落实。淘汰年产100万卷能力石油沥青纸胎油毡生产线、煤焦油基防水涂料和密封材料等的规定都得到较好的贯彻，二次成型聚乙烯丙纶卷材已基本退出市场。（5）新产品、新技术的研究开发和引进取得多方面的成果。高分子防水卷材胶粘剂、胶粘带的开发，玻纤沥青瓦、自粘防水卷材的生产和应用技术的开发，金属卷材、金属胎卷材的研发成果，为防水工程提供了更多的选择";s:3:"pid";s:2:"12";s:3:"bid";s:1:"2";s:4:"sort";s:1:"1";s:4:"time";s:10:"1380356905";}}}
